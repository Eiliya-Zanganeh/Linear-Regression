## What is linear regression?

---

Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between two variables. This algorithm is widely used in supervised machine learning.

In linear regression, the goal is to find a linear equation that best represents the relationship between the dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X).

## Applications of linear regression

---

* Prediction: Linear regression can be used to predict the future values ​​of the dependent variable based on the values ​​of the independent variables. For example, this method can be used to predict housing prices based on variables such as square footage, number of rooms, and location.

* Trend analysis: Linear regression can be used to check the change trend of a variable over time. For example, this method can be used to examine the trend of stock price changes over a period of time.

* Determining the relationship: Linear regression can be used to determine whether there is a significant relationship between two variables. For example, this method can be used to check whether there is a significant relationship between a person's level of education and income.

## Advantages of linear regression

---

* Simplicity: This algorithm is relatively simple and easy to understand and implement.

* Interpretability: The results of linear regression are easy to interpret.

* Efficiency: Linear regression is an efficient algorithm that can be run quickly on large data sets.

## Disadvantages of linear regression

---

* Sensitivity to anomalies: Linear regression is sensitive to anomalies in the data.

* Limiting assumptions: Linear regression assumptions may not hold for all data sets.

* Inability to model complex relationships: Linear regression can only model linear relationships between variables.
